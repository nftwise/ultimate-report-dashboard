## 🔍 **Why You're Getting $0.00**

### **Most Likely Reasons:**

### **1. Customer ID Permission Issue** ⚠️ (MOST LIKELY)

**Your Customer ID**: `2812810609`

**The Problem:**
- Your OAuth refresh token might not have **edit/admin** access to this customer ID
- Basic Access requires you to be directly added to the account
- You might only have "read-only" or "standard" access (not enough)

**How to Check:**
1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/overview
2. Look at accounts you can see
3. Check if `2812810609` is there
4. Click on the account
5. Check Settings → Users → Your permission level

**Required Permission:**
- ✅ Admin access (best)
- ✅ Standard access with edit permissions
- ❌ Read-only access (won't work)

### **2. OAuth Token Scope Issue** ⚠️

**Your Refresh Token**: `1//04BbmMCKjjhDQ...`

**The Problem:**
- The refresh token might not have the right scope
- Might be generated for a different account
- Might not include the customer ID you're trying to query

**Solution:**
- Regenerate refresh token with correct account
- Ensure you're logged in as account with access to customer ID

### **3. Customer ID Format**

**What I See:**
- Customer ID in clients.json: `2812810609`
- Should be: `281-281-0609` or `2812810609` (both work)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Format is correct
- ✅ API cleans it properly

---

## 🧪 **Let's Test What You CAN Access**

### **Test 1: List Accessible Customers**

I can create an endpoint that shows which customer IDs your token can access.

**This will tell us:**
- ✅ Which customer IDs you have access to
- ✅ What permission level you have
- ✅ If 2812810609 is accessible

### **Test 2: Check Permissions**

Test if your refresh token can read from this specific customer ID.

---

## 💡 **Possible Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Verify Customer ID Access** (TRY THIS FIRST)

**Check if you have access:**

1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/overview
2. Look at the account switcher (top right)
3. Can you see customer ID `2812810609`?
4. If yes, what's your role? (Admin, Standard, or Read-only?)

**If you can't see it:**
- ❌ Your OAuth token doesn't have access
- Need to add yourself to the account
- Or use a different customer ID

**If you can see it:**
- What's your permission level?
- You need **Admin** or **Standard (with edit)** access

### **Solution 2: Regenerate OAuth Token**

Your refresh token might be for the wrong account.

**Steps to regenerate:**

1. **Get a new refresh token** using OAuth Playground
2. **Ensure you're logged in** as the account with access to 2812810609
3. **Select correct scope**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords`
4. **Update** the refresh token in your .env

**OAuth Playground**: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/

### **Solution 3: Use Different Customer ID**

Try a customer ID you **definitely** have access to:

1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/overview
2. Copy the customer ID shown
3. Update in clients.json
4. Test again

### **Solution 4: Add Yourself to the Account**

If someone else owns customer ID 2812810609:

1. Ask them to invite you
2. Go to: Settings → Account access
3. Add your email with **Admin** access
4. Accept invitation
5. Try API again

## 🛠️ **What I Can Do Right Now**

### **Option A: Create Diagnostic Tool** (RECOMMENDED)

I'll create an API endpoint that:
- ✅ Lists all customer IDs you can access
- ✅ Shows your permission level for each
- ✅ Tests if 2812810609 is accessible
- ✅ Provides specific error messages

**Command**: Say "create diagnostic tool"

### **Option B: Try Different Customer ID**

Give me a customer ID you **know** you have access to, and I'll test it.

**Command**: Say "try customer ID: XXXXXXXXXX"

### **Option C: Add Mock Data (Still Works)**

While figuring out the real data access, add realistic mock data.

**Command**: Say "add mock data"

### **Option D: Help Regenerate Refresh Token**

I'll guide you through getting a new refresh token with correct permissions.

**Command**: Say "regenerate token"

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

### **Step 1: Run Diagnostic** (5 minutes)

Let me create a diagnostic tool that shows:
- Which customer IDs you can access
- Why 2812810609 isn't working
- What permission you need

### **Step 2: Fix the Issue** (10 minutes)

Based on diagnostic results:
- Use accessible customer ID, OR
- Add yourself to account 2812810609, OR
- Regenerate refresh token

### **Step 3: If Still Issues** (backup)

Add mock data while sorting out permissions.
