# How to Run Google Ads Diagnostic
**Date**: October 14, 2025

---

## üîç **Diagnostic Tool Created!**

I've created a diagnostic endpoint that will tell you **exactly** why your Google Ads API is returning $0.00.

---

## üöÄ **How to Run the Diagnostic**

### **Method 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment** (‚è≥ In Progress)

Once Vercel finishes deploying (should be done in a few minutes), visit:

```
https://ultimate-report-dashboard.vercel.app/api/google-ads/diagnose
```

**Or use curl:**
```bash
curl 'https://ultimate-report-dashboard.vercel.app/api/google-ads/diagnose'
```

---

### **Method 2: Check Vercel Deployment Status**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: `ultimate-report-dashboard`
3. Click: **Deployments**
4. Check the latest deployment status
5. Once it shows "Ready", the diagnostic will work

---

## üìä **What the Diagnostic Will Tell You**

The diagnostic tool will check:

### **‚úÖ Checks Performed:**

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Are all 4 Google Ads variables set?
   - Which ones are missing (if any)?

2. **API Client Initialization**
   - Can the Google Ads client be created?
   - Are credentials valid?

3. **List Accessible Customers**
   - Which customer IDs can you access with Basic Access?
   - How many accounts are available?

4. **Test Specific Customer ID (2812810609)**
   - Can you access this specific account?
   - What's the error if you can't?
   - Does this account exist?

### **üìã Results You'll Get:**

## ‚ö° **Quick Alternative While Waiting**

Since deployment is taking a moment, you can also:

### **Check Your Google Ads Account Manually:**

1. **Go to**: https://ads.google.com/aw/overview

2. **Look at Account Selector** (top right corner)

3. **Check Customer ID**:
   - Is `2812810609` (or `281-281-0609`) in the list?
   - If YES ‚Üí You have access, might be refresh token issue
   - If NO ‚Üí You don't have access to this account

4. **Check Your Role**:
   - Click on the account
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Account access
   - What's your role?
     - **Admin** ‚úÖ (Best - full access)
     - **Standard** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Needs edit permissions)
     - **Read-only** ‚ùå (Won't work with API)
     - **Not listed** ‚ùå (No access)

## üí° **Most Likely Issues (Based on Basic Access)**

### **Issue 1: Customer ID Not Accessible** (80% likely)

**Problem**: Your refresh token doesn't have access to customer ID `2812810609`

**Solution**:
- Use a different customer ID you have access to
- Or get added to account 2812810609 as Admin

### **Issue 2: Wrong Refresh Token** (15% likely)

**Problem**: Refresh token was generated for a different Google account

**Solution**:
- Regenerate refresh token with correct account
- Ensure you're logged into Google as the right user

### **Issue 3: No Active Campaigns** (5% likely)

**Problem**: Account exists but has no campaigns

**Solution**:
- Check if campaigns exist in Google Ads dashboard
- Try different date ranges
