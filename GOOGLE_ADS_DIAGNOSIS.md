## üéØ Root Causes (Most Likely)

### **1. Developer Token in Test Mode** ‚ö†Ô∏è (MOST LIKELY)

**Your Developer Token**: `7yGRpGwyFl6r7F_hv-7IEw`

**Issue**: If your developer token only has "Test Account" access, it can **ONLY** query test Google Ads accounts, not real production accounts.

**How to Check:**
1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter
2. Look for "API Access Level"
3. You'll see either:
   - **Test Access**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only works with test accounts
   - **Standard Access**: ‚úÖ Works with all accounts

**Solution if Test Access:**
- Apply for Standard Access at: https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter
- Or create a test Google Ads account
- Or use mock/sample data for demonstration

### **2. Customer ID Not Accessible** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Customer ID Tried**: `2812810609`

**Issue**: The OAuth refresh token might not have permission to access this customer ID.

**How to Check:**
1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/overview
2. Check which customer IDs you have access to
3. Verify `2812810609` is in your account list

**Solution:**
- Use a customer ID you have access to
- Grant access to the service account
- Use your own Google Ads account ID

### **3. No Active Campaigns** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: The customer ID might not have any active campaigns in the date range.

**Solution:**
- Check if campaigns exist in Google Ads dashboard
- Try different date ranges
- Ensure campaigns are not paused/removed

## üîß Quick Fixes

### **Option 1: Use Mock Data (Fastest - For Demo)**

I can add mock/sample data so your dashboard shows realistic numbers while you get API access sorted out.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ Shows realistic numbers
- ‚úÖ Good for demos/presentations

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Not real data
- ‚ùå Won't update

### **Option 2: Apply for Standard API Access**

1. Visit: https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter
2. Click "Apply for Standard Access"
3. Fill out the form
4. Wait for approval (can take a few days)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Access to real data
- ‚úÖ Works with any account

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Takes time to get approved
- ‚ùå Requires business verification

### **Option 3: Use a Test Account**

1. Create a test Google Ads account
2. Add test campaigns
3. Use that customer ID

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works with test token
- ‚úÖ Can control the data

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Not your real data
- ‚ùå Extra setup needed

### **Option 4: Check Customer ID Access**

Make sure your OAuth token has access:

1. Go to Google Ads dashboard
2. Check which accounts you can see
3. Use the correct customer ID

## üí° Recommended Solution

### **For Immediate Demo/Testing:**

**Use mock data** - I can add realistic sample data that shows:
- Ad spend: $2,500/month
- Cost per lead: $45
- Campaigns with metrics
- Phone call conversions
- Real-looking trends

This lets you demo the dashboard while sorting out API access.

### **For Production:**

1. **Apply for Standard Access** (if you don't have it)
2. **Verify Customer ID** is correct and accessible
3. **Check campaigns exist** in Google Ads dashboard

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Can Do Right Now

### **Option A: Add Mock Data**

I can create a fallback that shows realistic sample data when no real data is available. The dashboard will show:

```
Ad Spend: $2,345.67
Cost per Lead: $42.50
Campaigns: 3 active campaigns
Phone Calls: 12 conversions
Impressions: 45,234
Clicks: 1,234
```

**Command**: Tell me "add mock data" and I'll implement it.

### **Option B: Add Better Error Messages**

Show specific error messages on the dashboard like:
- "Google Ads API: Developer token needs Standard access"
- "Customer ID not accessible - please verify"
- "No campaigns found in date range"

**Command**: Tell me "add error messages" and I'll implement it.

### **Option C: Add Customer ID Validator**

Create a diagnostic endpoint that:
- Tests customer ID access
- Checks token permissions
- Shows which accounts are accessible
- Provides specific troubleshooting steps

**Command**: Tell me "add validator" and I'll implement it.
