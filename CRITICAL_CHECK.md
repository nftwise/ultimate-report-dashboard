  }
}
```

## ‚ùì **Critical Questions**

### **Question 1: Did You Add the Environment Variable?**

**Have you added this to Vercel?**

- Variable Name: `GOOGLE_ADS_MCC_ID`
- Value: `8432700368`
- Location: https://vercel.com/dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

**If NO:**
‚Üí This is why it's not working!
‚Üí Go add it now (takes 2 minutes)

**If YES:**
‚Üí Did you redeploy after adding it?
‚Üí Sometimes Vercel needs a redeploy to pick up new env vars

---

### **Question 2: Are There Active Campaigns?**

**Check your Google Ads account:**

1. Go to: https://ads.google.com
2. Switch to account: `281-281-0609`
3. Go to: Campaigns tab
4. Check:
   - Are there any campaigns listed?
   - Are they **ENABLED** (not paused)?
   - Do they have data from October 7-14, 2025?
   - Have they spent any money recently?

**If NO campaigns or all paused:**
‚Üí That's why API returns empty!
‚Üí Create/enable a campaign first

---

### **Question 3: Date Range Issue?**

The API is querying: **October 7-14, 2025**

**Do your campaigns have data in this date range?**
- Check in Google Ads dashboard
- Look at the date filter (top right)
- Select "Last 7 days"
- Do you see any impressions/clicks/cost?

**If NO data in this range:**
‚Üí Try different period: 30 days, 90 days
‚Üí Or check when campaigns were actually running

---

## üß™ **Quick Tests You Can Do**

### **Test 1: Check Account in Google Ads Dashboard**

1. Visit: https://ads.google.com
2. Select account: `281-281-0609` (My Chiropractic Practice)
3. Look at overview page
4. **Take a screenshot** of what you see

**Questions:**
- Do you see any numbers (impressions, clicks, cost)?
- What date range is selected?
- Are campaigns listed as ENABLED or PAUSED?

---

### **Test 2: Check MCC Access**

1. Visit: https://ads.google.com
2. Look at account selector (top right)
3. **Can you see BOTH accounts?**
   - MCC Manager: `843-270-0368`
   - Client: `281-281-0609`

4. **Switch between them** - does it work?

---

### **Test 3: Verify Environment Variable**

**Option A: Check Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: ultimate-report-dashboard
3. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

5. **Is it there?** YES / NO

2. Click latest deployment
3. Go to: Functions ‚Üí api/google-ads
4. Check logs for: "Using MCC account 8432700368"

## üí° **Most Likely Issues**

### **Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Added** (70% probability)

**Problem**: `GOOGLE_ADS_MCC_ID` not in Vercel

**Solution:**
1. Add to Vercel: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add: `GOOGLE_ADS_MCC_ID` = `8432700368`
4. Select: Production, Preview, Development
5. Save
6. Redeploy (or wait 2-3 min for auto-deploy)

---

### **Issue 2: No Active Campaigns** (20% probability)

**Problem**: Account has no campaigns or they're paused

**Check:**
- Go to Google Ads
- Look at campaigns
- Are any ENABLED?
- Do they have recent data?

**Solution:**
- Enable campaigns
- Or wait for campaigns to run
- Or use mock data for demo

---

### **Issue 3: Basic Access Limitation** (10% probability)

**Problem**: Basic Access still can't access MCC child accounts

**This could happen if:**
- MCC structure is more complex
- Additional permissions needed
- API access level issue

**Solution:**
- Apply for Standard Access
- Or add mock data temporarily

---

## üîß **Immediate Actions**

```

Look for in logs: "Using MCC account 8432700368"

---

### **Action 2: Try Different Date Range**

# Try 30 days
